      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const teams = players; // this is a reference and will not wokr the same as varibales. THIS IS BAD
      const teams2 = players.slice(); // this will make a copy and we can edit this without messing with players.
      const teams3 = [].concat(players);
      const teams4 = [...players]; //ES6 style.
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      teams[3] = "Lux"; // this will change the players array because teams is a reference to players.
      teams2[4] = "Lux2"; //this will only change teams 2

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesBos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.age = 99; // this will change the original object.

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap1 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.age = 100;
      cap3.social.twitter = "newTwitter";

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
